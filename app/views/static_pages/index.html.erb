      <p>As Software engineers - we are worried that there are way to few female colleagues in our industry
        - and we sincerely believe that it leads to poor quality of the software we produce. </p>

      <p>We want to help to change that and make computer science attractive for young women and help them
        pursue careers within information technology.</p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>

      <p>Womenâ€™s representation in the computing and information technology workforce has been falling. </p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>

      <p>The goal of the project is to create a palette of tools that individuals and organizations can use to deliver
        courses in their communities. Our goal is to offer a complete solution - we will build and open source
        comprehensive course content, web-based tools for learning, practical information for instructors and organizers
        and marketing materials.</p>
