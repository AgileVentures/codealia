      <h2>Women in Computer Science?</h2>

      <p>Codealia believes in diversity and we aspire to a future filled with smart, educated programmers - women as well as men. We are a dedicated group of software engineers who want to reverse the declining numbers of women in Computer Science.</p>

      <p>Codealia seeks to level the playing field by developing a free open-source learning platform with an engaging curriculum targeting young girls.  Our interactive program will foster collaboration, teamwork and open communication which will pave the way to future careers in the information technology field.</p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Women's representation in the computing and information technology workforce has been falling.</p>

      <p>An imbalanced non-inclusive workforce that fails to embrace the talent of women neglects the fact that women have surpassed men in Internet usage since the year 2000.</p>

      <p>Lack of diversity impairs an organization's ability to respond to an increasingly varied global user base. This negatively impacts relations with the surrounding community and reduces the organization's ability to respond to change.</p>

      <p>Users of IT products are just as likely to be women as men. However, most of these products are created with little or no input from female developers. We need broader, more inclusive perspectives in order to achieve better results.</p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p><!-- We are missing out on half of the customer base for our software products which ought to be built by people who understand the end user.  -->Increasing the number of women software engineers expands the creativity and responsiveness of our workforce.</p>
      
      <p>Codealia will build out a complete offering - a free open-source palette of tools, guides and lesson plans. </p><p>Individuals and organizations can use Codealia's tools to deliver both web-based and live computer science courses targeted towards girls in their communities.</p>

      <!-- <p>As Software engineers - we are worried that there are way to few female colleagues in our industry
        - and we sincerely believe that it leads to poor quality of the software we produce. </p>

      <p>We want to help to change that and make computer science attractive for young women and help them
        pursue careers within information technology.</p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>

      <p>Womenâ€™s representation in the computing and information technology workforce has been falling. </p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>

      <p>The goal of the project is to create a palette of tools that individuals and organizations can use to deliver
        courses in their communities. Our goal is to offer a complete solution - we will build and open source
        comprehensive course content, web-based tools for learning, practical information for instructors and organizers
        and marketing materials.</p> -->
