  </ul>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 35px;">"Codealia: Where girls learn to Code" is different from other computer science trainings. </h3>
  <br />
  <p>When it comes to teaching girls computer science, educators agree "the younger, the better".
    If you're on this page, then we assume that you are an educator,  parent, caregiver or friend of a young girl
    who could benefit from participating in the free Codealia program. </p>

  <p>Our curriculum is designed for young girls. We don't just teach them how to program,
    we also teach collaboration, cooperation and how to work in 'Agile' self-organizing teams.
    These relationship building skills go above and beyond just learning how to code. Codealia
    girls also learn how to solve problems, how to collaborate on a team and
    how to interact with technology as a creator and not just as a consumer.</p>

  <p>You as a Codealia volunteer, get to support and watch them grow in self-confidence and
    technical expertise. Get ready to be part of something new with lots of fun, laughter,
    surprises, pictures, debates & smiling faces! You can make a difference in the lives of these young girls.
    Come and join us!</p>
