  <p>Codealia has a strong emphasis on working together, co-operation and
    self-organising teams. With your contributions Codealia will be able to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Build out the learning platform.</li>
    <li>Provide hardware and tools to students.</li>
    <li>Organise venues where students can learn.</li>
    <li>Cover travel expenses for tutors and related costs.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We take an experience based approach in our courses. Based on the behavioral
    patterns of our young girls, we can achieve a higher level of commitment
    that creates a good learning atmosphere and leads to better results.</p>

  <p>In-kind donations of goods and services to help support our initiative are
    also welcome.</p>

  <p>The learning platform we envisage will require some funding to bring to
    fruition. We accept individual and institutional donations, however no
    official framework is yet in place for tax write-offs (we'll get there).
    <!-- To that end we've started a crowd funding campaign on
    <a href="http://igg.me/at/codealia/x">indiegogo.com</a> --></p>
