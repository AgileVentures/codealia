    <h2>Teaching Code</h2>

    <p>The goal of the Codealia project is to create a palette of tools that individuals and organizations can use to deliver programming courses in their communities. Our goal is to offer a complete solution - we will build open source, comprehensive course content and web-based tools for learning. Providing practical information for instructors and organizers along with marketing materials.</p>

    <p>We want to reach out to girls that normally don’t come in contact with computer science and demystify the world of engineering, in the hope that some might discover a gift for creative problem solving. We want to make young girls excited about the creative part of software development and we want them to feel the same enthusiasm we all felt the first time we created a program and saw the words “Hello World” on the screen.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-info"><p>The plan is to initially work with a local non-profit in Sweden and implement pilot programs in autumn of 2014.</p></div>

    <p>We take an experience based approach in our courses. Based on the behavioral patterns of our target audience, we can achieve a higher level of commitment that creates a good learning atmosphere and leads to better results.</p>

    <p>Join us on the <a href="http://www.agileventures.org/projects/lulu-codealia/" target="_blank">Agile Ventures</a> website where this project is being incubated (along with other open source learning initiatives) by an enthusiastic group of Rails developers.</p>
